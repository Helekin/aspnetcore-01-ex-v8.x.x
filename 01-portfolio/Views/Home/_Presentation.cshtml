        <h1>Let me introduce myself</h1>
        <p>
            Passionate about programming, I have a strong background in various programming languages, including C#,
            JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, Java,and C++. Additionally, I am well-versed in web technologies such as HTML,
            CSS, and Bootstrap, enabling me to create attractive and functional user interfaces. My expertise extends
            beyond front-end development, encompassing both relational databases like MySQL and SQL Server, and
            non-relational databases like MongoDB. This versatility has allowed me to tackle diverse and challenging
            projects, providing efficient and effective solutions. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and
            opportunities to apply my technical and creative skills. If you are seeking someone who brings experience
            and passion to the team, I would be delighted to connect with you.
